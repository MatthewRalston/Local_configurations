# README

This folder contains my local bash and emacs configuration. Currently installed emacs modules can be found in Modules.md

##Special configurations
* Ruby autocompletion
Currently, rsense and autocomplete.el are configured to provide ruby autocompletion with C-tab
* Emacs Speaks Statistics
Emacs speaks statistics is configured to deliver code to interactive server and return output via X11 with Cairo graphic support:
    M-x ssh [ENTER] servername [ENTER] -X -l username
    [Stats REPL, e.g. R]
    M-x ess-remote

##Future work
In the future, I will be adding additional configurations for LaTeX.
